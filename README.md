Hello :wave: I'm **Hobbs**; Network Cowboy and Mercenary Janitor for hire: [ascia.tech](https://ascia.tech).

I like to break stuff, solve interesting problems, and teach.  I hack on a wide array of things.  I'm especially interested in infosec, devoops, FLOSS, and decentralized systems/communities.  All of the standard links are in my profile sidebar.
