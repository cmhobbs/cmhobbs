```
Network Cowboy and Mercenary Janitor.  I do filty, nerdy things.

I like to break stuff, solve interesting problems, and teach.  I
I hack on a wide array of things.  I'm especially interested in
infosec, free software, and decentralized systems/communities.  
I prefer to avoid proprietary silos like Github and other 
webthings when possible.  Reach out via email if you would like
to collaborate or if you know a good joke:  cmhobbs@acm.org
