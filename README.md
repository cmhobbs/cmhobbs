```
Network Cowboy and Mercenary Janitor.  I do filthy, nerdy things.

I like to break stuff, solve interesting problems, and teach.  I
hack on a wide array of things.  I'm especially interested in
infosec, devoops, FLOSS, and decentralized systems/communities.  
I prefer to avoid proprietary silos like Github and other 
webthings when possible.
